### Traffic Line

Welcome to this mini-project! This project simulates a 2D traffic scene with moving cars. The setup creates 10 unique cars with random sizes and colors. Cars move across the screen and reset when off-screen. Traffic stops every 300 seconds to mimic real-world traffic flow. The environment includes a sky and a road as part of the scenery.

The tools used in this mini-project include:

- <b>p5.js Library</b>: A JavaScript framework for creative coding, used here to create and control the canvas, draw shapes, and handle animations.

- <b>Canvas API</b>: Utilized for drawing the environment, such as the road, sky, and cars on the canvas.

- <b>Basic Data Structures</b>: Arrays are used to store and manage multiple car objects efficiently.

- <b>Object Rendering</b>: Custom functions like renderCar() handle drawing and updating car properties on the screen.

- <b>Randomization</b>: The random() function is used to vary car dimensions, colors, and wheel sizes to create a dynamic visual scene.

You can see a demo and what it looks like:
